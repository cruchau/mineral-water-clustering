# Mineral Water Clustering Analysis 🌊 📊

## Overview
🎯 This project performs clustering analysis on mineral water data to identify patterns and groupings based on their chemical compositions. The analysis uses hierarchical and KMeans clustering methods to categorize different types of mineral water based on their mineral content.

## Dataset 📚
The dataset contains information about various mineral waters including their:
- 🧪 Chemical composition
- 💧 Mineral content
- ⚗️ pH levels
- 📋 Other relevant properties

The data is stored in `data/mineral-waters.xls`.

## Methods 🔬
The project implements two main clustering approaches:
1. 📈 Ward's method hierarchical clustering
2. 📊 Complete linkage hierarchical clustering

The analysis includes:
- 🔍 Data preprocessing and normalization
- 🌳 Hierarchical and KMeans clustering analysis
- 📉 Dendrogram and Scatter plot visualization
- 💡 Cluster interpretation
